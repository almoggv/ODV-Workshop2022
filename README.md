## Our mission
A wearable harness equipped with the device in the center of the body. It will help provide guidance to the visually impaired individual by detecting on-coming obstacles. 
This process will happen by alerting the user via sound / vibrations.
We aim to provide immediate and precise warning, and a full obstacle overcoming guidance -  based on our growing Database.
To make it easy to use and operate.
