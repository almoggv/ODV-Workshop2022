## Our mission
A wearable harness equipped with the device in the center of the body. It will help provide guidance to the visually impaired individual by detecting on-coming obstacles.

This process will happen by alerting the user via verbal sound or vibrations in accordance to the distance from the object and its location.

We aim to provide immediate and precise warnings and a full obstacle overcoming guidance - which will improve overtime using AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) based on our growing database.
All in a Plug&Play, User-Friendly and easy to use final product.
